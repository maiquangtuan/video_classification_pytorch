# video_classification_pytorch

This repository is code used for video classification based on ViViT and Movinet architecture. It was developed during my summer internship at NCSA when I and my team build a model that can detect violence content on video. The link to papers and repository I used for this code is below:

Movinet paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11511

ViViT paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15691

Implementation of ViViT paper from Rishikesh: https://github.com/rishikksh20/ViViT-pytorch

Implementation of Movinet from Atze00: https://github.com/Atze00/MoViNet-pytorch

The pretrained ViT from lukemelas: https://github.com/lukemelas/PyTorch-Pretrained-ViT
